# JavaFx

This repository contains a simple JavaFX example. Run `CellSpaceApp` to display a window with a button. When the button is pressed, a 3D view of a cell space built from six polygons appears. The cube is represented by a `CellSpace` object containing six `Polygon` instances, each defined by four `Vector3d` points. The `CellSpace` also computes a `StatePoint` in its center.
